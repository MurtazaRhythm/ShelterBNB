- Homeless shelter finder with capacity avaible


- we use google maps api to find the closet shelter to the client and show if spaces are avaible.



- to simulate the shelter capacities we will for now, make up the spaces to demo how our website would work.




- for database we will make a login for shelters, where they can see if there spaces avaible at their own shelters. they can adjust how much they are filled. we will then display that info on the website.
